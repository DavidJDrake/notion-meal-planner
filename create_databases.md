- Ingredients (Rich Text)
- Instructions (Rich Text) 
- Servings (Number)
- Prep Time (Number)
- Cook Time (Number)
- Cuisine (Select)
- Dietary Tags (Multi-select)
- Meal Type (Multi-select)

## 2. Meal Plan Database
Properties needed:
- Name (Title) - default
- Date (Date)
- Meal Type (Select)
- Recipe (Relation to Recipes)
- Servings (Number)
- Status (Select)
- Notes (Rich Text)
